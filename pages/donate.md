Vocal is 100% free and open source, but it costs money for us to keep the lights on. *Every donation, no matter how large or small, makes a big difference in the project.*

Your money will be used for a number of purposes, including:

* Costs associated with maintaining the website (domain name renewal, bandwidth and hosting, etc.)
* Saying thank you to volunteers who contribute substantially to the project
* Helping Nathan, the lead developer, keep food on his table
* And more!
