One thing has always been true about the people involved with Vocal: we love podcasts. We believe that they provide some of the most engaging, thought provoking, and entertaining audio and video content in the world. 

The number one question we get from users after installation is, “what are some good podcasts?” We decided to put together a starter pack with what we think is a selection of great podcasts that are sure to get you hooked! No matter what you are interested in, you're sure to find something that you will love.

# Download

You can choose each feed individually below, or [download the entire pack here](http://www.vocalproject.net/s/Vocal-Podcast-Starter-Pack.opml). Just open Vocal and import the .opml file that you have downloaded.
