title: Developer Q&A
---

If you missed the live developer Q&A over the weekend the entire hangout was archived on YouTube and is embedded below. For best results we recommend skipping to [5:45](https://youtu.be/Lf8V-0RySJE?t=346&t=5m45s) to avoid the initial setup and technical hiccups. This Q&A session covers lots of questions about our [IndieGoGo Crowdfunding Campaign](http://igg.me/at/vocal), plans for Vocal 2.0, Birdie 2.0, and more.

Please let us know in the comments if you would like to do another live Q&A session. In the meantime, please enjoy the archived video and [consider contributing to our campaign](http://igg.me/at/vocal) if you like what you hear.
