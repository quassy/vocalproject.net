title: Welcome to Vocal's New Home
---

As many of you know, from the very beginning of this project I have been posting all the development updates and announcements on my own personal blog. It has served me well, but it didn't take long for me to realize that I needed a different solution. It was too difficult for people to learn more about Vocal. I wanted a site that would showcase some of the features it had to offer, give potential users a simple way to figure out how to download it and try it for themselves, and also make it easy for contributors to discover how to get involved.

As luck would have it, I received an email early on from a web developer named Matt Harwood who wanted to help out with the project. Although this isn't the site he was working on, much of its design and functionality is heavily influenced by the original work he put in. I just want to take a moment and publicly thank him for his help. Thanks Matt!

From now on you will be able to find all development updates, official announcements, and other project-specific posts here on our new blog. You will probably notice that the "Team" listing on the about page only has my ugly mug on it. I would love to see more and more faces added to that page. If you want to get involved and start making significant contributions to the project, our new Get Involved page is a good place to start. And as always, donations make a huge difference and are greatly appreciated.

So go kick the tires and enjoy our new site.
