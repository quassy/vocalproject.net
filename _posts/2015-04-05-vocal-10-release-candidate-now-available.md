Exactly one year ago, on April 5th, 2014, I announced Vocal to the world. Today I am very excited to announce that the version 1.0 release candidate is now available! This represents the past year of work and is the final stage before our first major release!

[The installation packages and instructions can be found here, at our downloads page.]({{ site.baseurl}}/download/) If you're an elementary OS Freya user it's as simple as downloading the .deb installer and opening it with software center (or from the terminal if that's your preferred method).

Although Vocal is designed primarily for elementary OS it should also work well in other distributions. Ubuntu-based systems can install using the provided .deb packages as well, although you will also need to install a few additional packages. For now, if you're using a distro that is not based on Debian you'll have to install from source. Packages for Fedora (RPMs) and Arch will be available for the final release, but for our release candidate I'm still trying to keep things simple. **Please note:** Vocal requires GTK 3.14 or higher to run, so you'll need a recent release of your distribution.

The release candidate stage means that the first stable release is almost here! We believe Vocal is starting to feel pretty stable, so we want to get it in the hands of as many users as possible for them to kick the tires before we declare that it's ready for everyone. If you run into any issues [please report them here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/vocal) so we can fix any high-priority bugs before the release.

Also, if you speak multiple languages [**please consider helping us translate Vocal!**](https://translations.launchpad.net/vocal) We want as many people as possible to be able to use it in their own native language.

**Assuming the release candidate period goes well, we're aiming to release our final version on Sunday, April 19th.** If we get several critical bugs we may have to push that date back, but for now that's our goal.

Please enjoy the release candidate, and be sure to let us know how it goes! You can leave a comment here, [tag us in a post on Google+](https://plus.google.com/b/115162318639836328992/115162318639836328992), or send me a message on Twitter ([@nathandyer_me](https://twitter.com/nathandyer_me)).

Thanks to all the people who contributed artwork or patches during our first cycle! I hope you all enjoy!
