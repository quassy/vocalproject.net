title: New Saved State Features Now Available
---

Good news for fans of long podcasts: Vocal now remembers exactly where you leave off in each episode, and starts playback at the same position. That means no more hunting around trying to find your place.

Not only that, but it also picks back up to the same episode and position as the last time you used it. Just hit play and continue enjoying your podcast without missing a beat.

See for yourself (sorry, the audio didn't record properly):

Several other new features and bug fixes have landed this past week, including confirming that you want to quit if you have episodes downloading, and some improvements to text in the playback area for users of different themes and systems.

These new features are fresh out of the oven and guaranteed to have bugs. [Please report them in the usual way.]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-involved)
